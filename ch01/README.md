#  Chapter 1: Introduction
## Exercise 1.1
> Write a program to solve the selection problem. Let k = n/2. Draw a table showing the running time of your program for various values of n.

[Algorithm-1]()    [Algorithm-2]()

|   |100|1000|10000|100000|
|---|---|----|-----|------|
|Algorithm-1|0.001|0.005|0.251|26.741|
|Algorithm-2|0.001|0.004|0.077|6.734|

Obviously, when the number of elements are large, the running time of algorithm-2 is much shorter than that of algorithm-1.

## Exercise 1.2
>Write a program to solve the word puzzle problem.
