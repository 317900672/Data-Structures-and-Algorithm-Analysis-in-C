#  Chapter 1: Introduction
## Exercise 1.1

[Algorithm-1](https://github.com/seineo/Solutions-for-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis-in-C-2th-exercises/blob/master/ch01/ex1_01_algorithm-1.cpp)  
[Algorithm-2](https://github.com/seineo/Solutions-for-Data-Structures-and-Algorithm-Analysis-in-C-2th-exercises/blob/master/ch01/ex1_01_algorithm-2.cpp)

|   |100|1000|10000|100000|
|---|---|----|-----|------|
|Algorithm-1|0.001|0.005|0.251|26.741|
|Algorithm-2|0.001|0.004|0.077|6.734|

Obviously, when the number of elements are large, the running time of algorithm-2 is much shorter than that of algorithm-1.
