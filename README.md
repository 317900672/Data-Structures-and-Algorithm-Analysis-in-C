# Solutions to Exercises
## Notes
* Finished in C++.
* Use IDE : `Visual Studio 2017 Community` / text editor : `Sublime Text 3`.
* Use `gcc version 6.3.0`(MinGW.org GCC-6.3.0-1).
* Use `-std=c++11`(recommend: `-pedantic -Wall`) flag for compiling.
* Solutions for mathematical exercises were `omitted`(Because formulas are hard to write down here).
* I would like to know about `errors in my answers`
* May `update slowly`
